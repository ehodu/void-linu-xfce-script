### How to use

After installing the base system and also `git`, clone this repository and run the script. DON'T RUN THE FIST TWO COMMANDS USING `SUDO`, JUST the last one as below:

`git clone https://github.com/ehodu/void-linux-xfce-script.git`

`cd void-linux-xfce-script` 

`sudo sh main.sh` 

Wait for installation and be happy.
